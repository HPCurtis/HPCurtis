# Welcome to my github.
Hello my names Harrison Curtis (coding cowboy). I am a former Data scientist and quantitative methodologist at University of Reading [EBRlab](https://github.com/ebrlab/Statistical-methods-for-research-workers-bayes-for-psychologists-and-neuroscientists) 2020/2023. Working primarily on the Bayesian workflow for psychometrics/item response theory, [see](https://github.com/ebrlab/CHS_analysis_GRM), as well as fMRI and EEG timeseries analysis, [see](https://github.com/ebrlab/Bayesian_MGRW_LKJ_ERP), and how these methods could be implemented in the current analytical landscape dominated by "old school" methods. Recent i have put a heavy focus on cutting edge developments of predictive inference using Machine learning methods. I am Looking forward to apply what I have learned and applied outisde of academia in industry. 

When I am not coding im working with my hands üî® or dancing üï∫üèª.
